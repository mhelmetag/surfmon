    <p>
      Surfmon is a little like IFTTT (If This Than That) for surfing. I wanted a tool for building my own <strong>custom surf alerts</strong>
      so that I don't have to monitor the charts. If you've thought "I would love an email for the days that the
      swell direction is between A and B degrees, the period is C and the swell height is D" then Surfmon might be for
      you!

    <h3 class="is-size-3">How do I use it?</h3>
    <p>
      Surfmon is built around "alerts" and "conditions". You create an alert using a spot or subregion ID then build
      out the condition you want to trigger an email. On Sunday afternoon, Surfmon will send you an email with a list of
      alerts and the days their conditions are met.

    <p>I have a few ideas milling around for what's next. None are in any particular order or priority.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple conditions (probably the next thing I work on)</li>
      <li>More sources (these are things like swell, wind, tide, etc)</li>
      <li>Other providers (like MSW, NOAA, others??)</li>
      <li>Picking when you want emails/alerts</li>
      <li>Sharing alert configurations with friends via links (teach your friends what conditions are good for your
        area)</li>
      <li>Setting up group alerts for your crew</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you have an idea and I'm not getting to it fast enough, let me know
      at <a href="mailto:support@maxworld.tech">support@maxworld.tech</a>. I'd love to hear from you!
