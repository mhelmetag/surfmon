# Surfmon

Surf monitoring

## Setup

You'll need:

- Ruby 3.1.0
- PostgreSQL (I'm using 12)

Then you can run to setup:

```sh
bundle
bin/rails db:setup
```

Then you can start your dev environment with:

```sh
bin/rails s
```

## Test

Test things that are important, confusing or complex (or any combination of those). Nothing near 100% coverage is required.

```sh
bundle exec rails t
```
